# ResearchCruiseApp - frontend

## Development

- Install dependencies: `vp install`
- Setup database: `vp run seed`
- Start dev server: `vp run dev`
- Regenerate the API client after backend contract changes: `vp run gen`
- Production build: `vp run build`

The backend build writes the checked-in OpenAPI document to
`backend/ResearchCruiseApp/openapi/ResearchCruiseApp_v2.json`. Orval generates the fetch client,
TanStack Query hooks, and Zod schemas under `src/api/gen`; commit both outputs.

## Tests (Playwright)

- Install browsers (first time / CI): `vp dlx playwright install --with-deps`
- Run tests: `vp run test`
